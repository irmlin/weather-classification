Created two image classification models using tensorflow. The first model used tensorflow's hyperband for searching optimal hyperameters, it achieved an accuracy of around 60%. The second model was built around an already pretrained mobilenetV2 model. Utilizing the transfer learning technique increased model's accuracy by a few percent, the model also generelized better and was less overfit.
